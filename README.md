## Overview

### Idea
This is a project with a basic implementation of React.js and APIs. At UCSB Fall 2017, I built an app using mapbox API to
show on a map where a nearby fire would be. I actually got it to work... only I was building it when the Thomas Fire affected the
area. While we faced many challenges as classmates and neighbors within the community, I was building this app with a first-hand
experience testing my own product out in my own situation. It wasn't very advanced, but it was a very surreal moment for me. I am
now building this Weather Forecasting app to do one simple thing using React to change from my use of Vanilla JavaScript (pre ES6)
on the Fire App.

## My Process
### Built With
I started with Create React App then installed dependencies React-Bootstrap, React-Geocode, and configure an OpenWeatherMap API key.

### What I Learned
I learned to make API calls in the context of a React App, and learned the importance of placement in an API call to avoid unnecessary 
calls.
